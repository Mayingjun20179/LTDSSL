This is the data and code for the paper "Yingjun Ma, Junjiang Zhong. Logistic tensor decomposition with sparse subspace learning for prediction of multiple disease types of human–virus protein–protein interactions[J]. Briefings in Bioinformatics, 2023, 24(1), bbac604. DOI: 10.1093/bib/bbac604".  Please cite if you use this code.

To run the code:
1. Change Matlab work directory to "/LTDSSL/".

2. Run  "loadpah" code to add the current folder and subfolders into Matlab path searching list.

3. Open and run the mianZ.m. 



The “Algorithms” folder contains the relevant calculation code for LTDSSL:

LTDSSL_opt.m：Logistic tensor decomposition with sparse subspace learning.


The Dataset folder contains all experimental data in this paper:

"exper_data.mat" is the data format of matlab, which stores all the data of this experiment

"Experimental_data_all.xlsx" is the data file of this study, including human (virus) protein ID, human (virus) protein sequence, human (virus) protein pseAAC feature, human (virus) protein CTD feature, and 6 Human (viral) protein association in central vascular disease.


The “cv_experiment” folder contains related experiments on HVD:

(1) 'cv_type': Evaluate the accuracy of the model in predicting disease types.

(2) 'cv_triplet': Evaluate the predictive ability of the model on the human–virus–disease triplets.

(3) 'cv_virus': Evaluate the predictive power of the model with respect to virus proteins.

(4)'cv_human': Evaluate the predictive power of the model with respect to human proteins.





In this package, we used the tensor tensor_toolbox-v3.1, which is downloaded from (https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/-/releases/v3.1)
