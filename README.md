# LTDSSL
Logistic tensor decomposition with sparse subspace learning for prediction of multiple disease types of human-virus protein-protein interactions

1. The compressed package "LTDSSL_CP_BCPF" contains three methods LTDSSL, CP and BCPF, and two benchmark datasets "HMDD v3.2" and "HVD" for cross-experimentation in this paper.

The folder "human_virus_data" corresponds to the data and code corresponding to the benchmark dataset "HVD";

The folder "hmddv3_data" corresponds to the data and code corresponding to the benchmark dataset "HMDD v3.2";

The codes of these three methods are realized by using matlab language.


2. The compressed package "TDRC_TFAI_TFLP_WeightTDAIGN" contains four methods TDRC, TFAI, TFLP and WeightTDAIGN, and two benchmark datasets "HMDD v3.2" and "HVD" for cross-experimentation in this paper.

The folder "human_virus_data" corresponds to the data and code corresponding to the benchmark dataset "HVD";

The folder "hmddv3_data" corresponds to the data and code corresponding to the benchmark dataset "HMDD v3.2";

The codes of these three methods are implemented in python language.

Unzip the two compressed packages separately, and the "README.txt" file in the corresponding folder of each compressed package introduces the functions and operation methods in detail.
