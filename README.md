# LTDSSL
Logistic tensor decomposition with sparse subspace learning for prediction of multiple disease types of human-virus protein-protein interactions

(1) The compressed package "LTDSSL_CP_BCPF" contains the code of three methods: "LTDSSL", "CP" and "BCPF". The code of these three methods is realized by using matlab language.

(2) The compressed package "TDRC_TFAI_TFLP_WeightTDAIGN" contains the code of "TDRC", "TFAI", "TFLP" and "WeightTDAIGN". The code of these four methods is implemented by using python language.

Unzip the two packages separately, and the "README.txt" file in each package gives a detailed description of the function and how to run it.
